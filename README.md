Classic game Tetris (Golang)

# How To Run Tetris

1. Install Golang
2. Download source code and extract
3. Open a terminal (cmd.exe in Windows), and change working directory to the folder you just extracted
4. Enter `go run .` and enjoy! 

- Maybe Golang needs some more configuations. 
If you do not wanna handle that, and it happenes to you that you're using Windows, then you can just run `tetris.exe` to enjoy it.
